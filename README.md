- 👋 Hi, I’m Cindy Adem, aka @ProductQueen
- 👀 I’m interested in the connection between product management and AI 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I've got to get my AI game up
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source projects that need a product manager who can design and analyse data
- 📫 How to reach me: @cindyadem on twitter
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy making art while listening to soft French jazz.
